= Usermanual Reset-M1 plugin
 
== General
	This plugin is made, to do several things.
	After startup, the plugin will ask if you like to backup your M1.
	If this will be confirmed, each single drive on the controller will be checked and with
	popup-windows the plugin will ask you to backup one by one. 
		e.g. flash0, nvram0, cfc0, cfc0_1 and so on
	
	If this is done, the plugin will ask you, if you are sure to format the drives of the M1.
	If this is confirmed, the plugin will ask again for each single drive.
	If a folder called "keys" is detected on one of the drives, the script will ask again if you are sure to delete this folder.
	
	If all choosen drives are formated, the plugin will ask you which mbase version you like to copy to the bootdevice.
	The choosen one will be copied and the last IP-address will be added to the mconfig.ini.
	
	At the end the plugin will ask for reboot the M1 to finalize the reset.
