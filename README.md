# EASE-Reset-M1
SolutionCenter EASE script to reset a M1 controller in state of delivery
The at.bachmann.script.catalog_1.0.0.202101071426.jar plugin file have to be copied to the "installation path of your solutionCenter-Version"/dropins and restart the SolutionCenter.

To enable a quick start in the Solution navigator toolbar, add the path of the script "controller_reset" to the PReferences:
Window -> Preferences
            -> Scripting
                -> Script Locations
                    
add e.g. workspace://EASE-Reset-M1 here for a workspace link if the project is stored in your workspace.
Otherwise choose the link of your filesystem where the project is stored.
